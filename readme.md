# echo-gcs-middleware

---

This Echo middleware provides a static file store powered by Google Cloud Storage as its backend. In detail, it facilitates the efficient delivery of static files—such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files—stored in Google Cloud Storage directly to end users. By leveraging this middleware, you can host static content on GCS without embedding these files directly within your application code, enabling seamless access to the content via HTTP requests.
